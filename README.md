Robot Movements
A robot is located in the upper-left corner of a 4Ã—4 grid. The robot can move either up, down, left, or right, but cannot go to the same location twice.
The robot is trying to reach the lower-right corner of the grid. Your task is to find out the number of unique ways to reach the destination. 

Package Problem
 You want to send your friend a package with different things. Each thing you put inside the package has such parameters as index number, weight and cost. 
The package has a weight limit. Your goal is to determine which things to put into the package so that 
the total weight is less than or equal to the package limit and the total cost is as large as possible.
You would prefer to send a package which weights less in case there is more than one package with the same price.
